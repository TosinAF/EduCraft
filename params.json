{"name":"Educraft","tagline":"A Minecraft Mod to create a collaborative game that teaches key stage 2 maths","body":"<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TosinAF/EduCraft/master/logo.png\" width=\"200%\">\r\n\r\n#Description\r\n\r\nThe EduCraft project is concerned with developing a series of\r\nextensions for the popular computer game\r\nMinecraft, aimed at promoting collaborative learning in primary schools,\r\nparticularly with reference to numeracy education.\r\n\r\n#Why is EduCraft Needed?\r\n\r\nAs a game Minecraft is currently very popular with a wide range of age groups including the 8 to 11 age range. At this stage in their development one of the most important learning outcomes that are sort is the ability to learn <b>collaboratively</b>. \r\n\r\nIt is difficult for children to understand the reason for collaboration when so much of what they do is competitive but in a lot of situations learning can be much more effective if done collaboratively. \r\n\r\nSurvival & World Based Games present a naturally collaborative environment & with EduCraft we plan to leverage this environment in order to create a learning tool to teach Key Stage 2 Maths & the advantages of collaboration.\r\n\r\nEduCraft is being developed as a mod for the Minecraft game (using Minecraft Forge) to create an environment in which players can only progress by collaborating with others.
