#Description

The EduCraft project is concerned with developing a series of
extensions for the popular computer game
Minecraft, aimed at promoting collaborative learning in primary schools,
particularly with reference to numeracy education.

#Why is EduCraft Needed?

As a game Minecraft is currently very popular with a wide range of age groups including the 8 to 11 age range. At this stage in their development one of the most important learning outcomes that are sort is the ability to learn <b>collaboratively</b>. 

It is difficult for children to understand the reason for collaboration when so much of what they do is competitive but in a lot of situations learning can be much more effective if done collaboratively. 

Survival & World Based Games present a naturally collaborative environment & with EduCraft we plan to leverage this environment in order to create a learning tool to teach Key Stage 2 Maths & the advantages of collaboration.

EduCraft is being developed as a mod for the Minecraft game (using Minecraft Forge) to create an environment in which players can only progress by collaborating with others. The source for the project can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/TosinAF/EduCraft">here</a>

Weekly Backups of the codebase are stored on this site.
